# Hey there, I'm Ahmed 👋

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually work. Started coding in 2019, and honestly, it just clicked. Now I spend my days turning ideas into real applications that people can use.

## What I Do

I build web and mobile apps from scratch—frontend, backend, databases, the whole stack. I like working on projects where I can see the impact, whether that's a clean portfolio site or a full AI-powered app.

**Tech I work with:**
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Firebase, PostgreSQL
- **Mobile:** Flutter, React Native
- **Tools:** Git, Vercel, Prisma, AI APIs

## Currently

🔨 Working on AI-integrated web applications  
📱 Building mobile apps with Flutter  
🎨 Perfecting that balance between design and performance  
📚 Always learning—right now diving deeper into AI/ML integration

## Some Things I've Built

- **Portfolio Sites** – Clean, responsive, and actually fast
- **AI Chat Apps** – Real-time streaming, database persistence, the works
- **Mobile Apps** – Cross-platform with Flutter
- **Full-Stack Web Apps** – Authentication, databases, deployment, all of it
